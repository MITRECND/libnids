                                 libnids-1.26
                             ====================

	The following applies to Linux only.
	Linux 2.0.x kernels introduces sockets of family PF_PACKET which
allow to gather packets from all devices, including loopback (!). Recent
libpcap versions (0.6.x for sure) support this feature; you have to pass
device "any" to pcap_open_live in order to listen on such a socket. For
backwards compatibility with libnids <= 1.16, you can also assign device "all"
to nids_params.device. If nids_params.promisc is nonzero, libnids (because
libpcap does not support it) will try to set all interfaces into promiscuous 
mode, one by one.  
	A certain problem may arise, if the machine routes packets among its
interfaces. Libpcap will pass to userspace a copy of a packet per each
interface this packet travels through. This is no problem for libnids TCP
reassembly, as it deals perfectly with duplicate packets - tcp callback
functions will not notice anything unusual. However, UDP and IP callbacks
will receive duplicate packets.
