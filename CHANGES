v1.26 Sep 24 2015
- Set default tcp_flow_timeout to 1 hour, which should cover most firewalls'
and OS's TCP idle timeout

v1.25 Feb 18 2013
- added timeouts for tcp streams

v1.24 Mar 14 2010
- fixed another remotely triggerable NULL dereference in ip_fragment.c
- unofficial patch that enables tracking of already established TCP connections
- missing reset of some tcp_* variables upon nids_exit
- correct calculation of radiotap header
- compilation warning fixes with newer gcc
- use pcap_get_selectable_fd() instead of pcap_fileno()

v1.23 Feb 23 2008
- fixed remotely triggerable NULL dereference in ip_fragment.c
- fix DLT_PRISM_HEADER linkoffset calculation
- check for DATA_FRAME_IS_QOS in wireless frames
- free queued tcp segments with too old seq

v1.22 Jul 22 2007
- in TCP stream, the byte with absolute offset 0 was treated as urgent data;
fixed
- DLT_IEEE802_11_RADIO handling
- added a few missing checks for failed malloc
 
v1.21 May 10 2006
- more externals to access libnids' intrinsics from the outside
- nids_unregister_*()
- UDP checksumming fix (0 is not an error according to RFC768)
- nids_params.tcp_workarounds
- nids_params.multiproc and queue_limit: merged a patch which creates a 
separate thread for packet capture; 
- in killtcp.c, send two more RST packets (required because of MS05-019
patch)
- glibc 2.4 syslog.h disaster workaround

v1.20 Feb 4 2005
- added wscale option parsing; surprisingly, it seems to be in some use
- added nids_dispatch(), for systems which do not ignore pcap timeout
- ability to specify hosts/networks for which we do not check checksums

v1.19 Aug 08 2004
- fixed signed/unsigned comparisons; 1.18 could be possibly crashed in tcp
  options parsing (though an unlikely to happen memory layout is required);
  now the source is compiled with -W -Wall
- export pcap header of the last received packet (to get timestamp etc)
- export the timeout parameter to pcap_open_live in params
- support DLT_PRISM_HEADER
- support DLT_PPP_SERIAL
- let through dataless acks
- fixed raw_init() prototype
- switched to use %edi instead of %ebx in csum_partial to make gcc-3.5 happy
  when compiling with -fPIC; cleaned inline asm
- fixed a bug when a queued FIN segment was not processed properly, which
  resulted in not closing a stream

v1.18 Oct 15 2003
- reject tcp packets with old timestamp; needed to pass fragroute test;
  well, linux 2.0.36 did not support this ;)
- fixed memory corruption which could be caused by overlarge TCP packets
- adjusted checksum.c to not use multiline literals (for gcc 3.3)
- in configure.in, even if found libnet files, try compilation; there is
  another library with the same name
- fix a bug in "collect" field handling; if you did collect-- and then
  collect++ (which is rare), you would get a single junk packet
- correct handling of exec_prefix in configure.in
- unlink config.status in "make distclean"
- use pcap_hdr->caplen instead pcap_hdr->len; the only gain seems to be to
  gracefully handle pcap files with too short snaplen
- changed soname to libnids.so.1.x, as binary compatibility is not
  guaranteed
- switched to sourceforge as homepage

v1.17 Dec 12 2002
- fixed a stupid bug in TCP reassembly; having received a particular order
  of TCP out of frame segments, libnids could lost track of the current 
  seq, and miss the following data stream
- DLT_FDDI
- benign typo in hash.c
- mentioned usefulness of two process buffering on a fast network

v1.17rc1 Aug 30 2002
- support for libnet-1.1 and --with-libnet=no
- added support for libpcap save files
- finally, DLT_LINUX_SLL is recognized
- removed a horrible assumption on sizeof(pointer); it could result in
  segfault in scan.c
- --enable-shared
- __i386 -> __i386__ || __i386 :(
- support for 802.1Q VLAN 
- support for wireless frames (DLT_IEEE802_11)
- got rid of (obsolete) pcap_open_live_new
- bail out if link type is unknown, instead of pretending it is ethernet
- $(MAKE) -> $(MAKE) $(AM_MAKEFLAGS)
- added a working link to Ptacek-Newsham paper
- %hi -> %hu :)
- align IP header if necessary (should not be)
- improved libraries detection
- mentioned usefulness od setsockopt(...SO_RCVBUF...) on a fast network

v1.16 Nov 3 2000
- nah, at least a release forced by a security bug. A typo in libnids.c
could cause libnids to segfault when source routed frame has been received.

v1.15 Oct 9 2000
- token ring support
- new configurable option (non-default): if a tcp callback hasn't processed 
  all available data, it is called immediately again
- fixed alignment in hash.c, which caused sigsegv on Sparc
- another _obviously_ redundant include file added to configure test progs
- html version of the API documentation

v1.14 Jun 28 2000
- fixed memory leak in tcp.c (queued tcp segments used to be not freed
  after connection termination)
- added support to capture packets on all interfaces, including loopback
  (linux only, using new libpcap features - autoconf changed)
- added nids_register_udp(); if anyone cares for UDP checksums...
- stupid bug in nids_register_ip_frag() fixed
- removed comments from asm code in checksum.c; Solaris compiler didn't
  recognized them - sigh
- signed/unsigned bug in scan.c fixed
- tcp callback could be notified even if no nw data arrived - fixed
- added ability to disable tcp processing
- added ability to refrain from setting promisc flag
- libc5 support
- alpha platform support
- now it's possible to do setuid(nobody) after nids_init() with no loss
  of functionality (killtcp works)
- removed pcap_lookupnet() call - one can capture packets from an interface
  with no IP assigned
- hash function in tcp.c with pseudorandom parameters
- #define NIDS_MAJOR 1, #define NIDS_MINOR 14 in nids.h

v1.13 Jan 18 2000
- Changes by Dug Song:
  - GNU autoconf support
  - code cleanup and new libnids(3) manpage
  - disable portscan detection if scan_num_hosts == 0
  - new field in nids_params for pcap(3) support: pcap_filter
  - subtle bugfix in ip_check_ext()
  - Solaris support (endianness fixes, etc.)
- another tiny check in tcp.c 

v1.12 Sep 15 1999
- processing of ICMP Destination Unreachable 
- nids_next() and nids_getfd() functions added; new fields in nids_params:
  no_mem, ip_filter
- clean error reporting via nids_errbuf; used by nids_init(), nids_next(), 
  nids_getfd()
- some more samples

v1.11 Aug 20 1999
- some stupid bugs removed (hopefully no more segfaults)

v1.1 Aug 10 1999
- *BSD support added by Dug Song
- some minor cleanups in libnids.c
- changed the license to GPL

v1.0 July 30 1999 
- Initial public release
